# Pummel Pups

> A realtime multiplayer 2D battle arena for the browser

## Setup

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

It is highly recommended to use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (nvm) to install Node.js and npm.

For Windows users there is [Node Version Manager for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).

Install Node.js and `npm` with `nvm`:

```bash
nvm install node

nvm use node
```

Replace 'node' with 'latest' for `nvm-windows`.

## Getting Started

From the root, install dependencies:

```
npm i
```

You can run the server and client in the same terminal with this command:

```
npm run dev
```

Launch the game client in the browser on localhost, port 8000
